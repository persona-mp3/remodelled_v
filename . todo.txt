i. need to get the user to have a configured username??
- we could get it from the env variable through bash/go directly, if thats allowed

ii. okay, then, we'd need to read it for every commit

- so 
- when a new init is done, an env is set for the user
- we can use a random domain like @k2studios
-- username@k2stuios, or username@suffix
-- so go can directly use it. dont need it to be a file operation, thats uneccessary
---> seems theres more alot to that, but a lil .sh could suffice.



- handle erros, rn everything just panics
