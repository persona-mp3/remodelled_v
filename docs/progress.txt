Now, I've been able to get the basic file processess:
i. Upon ```go run main.go --init ""```, all folders are initiated
ii. On ```go run main.go --commit "commit-msg"```, branch is updated to the latest commit and is added to the logs
iii. Get previous parent upon new commit 

TODO:
iv. Compression Algorithm
- Python scripting
- Bash Scripting

v. Now that i've kind of dablled with basic compression algorithm, for now, i think i'd want to write it in python, but the only problems i can see right now are executing the file via GOLang, compatibility issues, and possuibly how other OS might want to do that, also folder structure, but now, i think i need to make a staging area
